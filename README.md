# RBras-2018
Codes and files

Hello!

Welcome to my Project for the 63rd RBras Conference, to be held in Curitiba, in 2018. Currently, I am the only student involved in this project.

The project involves S4 programming, using the R language. Its purpose is to develop a reliable R Package for users who want to understand more about the S4 classes and methods, using a somewhat silly scenario.

For this project, I am being advised by Professor Walmes Marques Zeviani, currently teaching at Universidade Federal do Paran√°.

The content of this repository is public. However, if you want to use any of it, I kindly ask of you to have a word or two with me first. Maybe we can be of use to each other!

Without further ado, I hope you find what you are looking for here. 

Kind regards,

Hektor.
